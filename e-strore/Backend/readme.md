# Admin Authentication System Guide
üîê Admin Login Methods
Method 1: Secret Key Registration (Recommended)
Endpoint: POST /api/auth/admin/register
json{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Admin",
  "email": "admin@yourplatform.com",
  "password": "SecureAdmin123",
  "confirmPassword": "SecureAdmin123",
  "adminSecretKey": "your-secret-admin-key"
}
How it works:

Requires a secret key (ADMIN_SECRET_KEY) in environment variables
Only people with the secret key can create admin accounts
First admin becomes "Super Admin" with full permissions
Subsequent admins have standard permissions

üèóÔ∏è Admin Hierarchy
Super Admin

First admin created automatically becomes super admin
Full platform control - can do everything
Can create other admins with standard permissions
Cannot be deleted by other admins
Ultimate authority in disputes and decisions

Standard Admin

Platform management - user management, seller approval, etc.
Cannot create other admins (only super admin can)
Can be managed by super admin
Standard permissions for day-to-day operations

üîÑ Complete Login Flow
javascript// Step 1: Admin registers (one-time setup)
POST /api/auth/admin/register
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Admin", 
  "email": "john@admin.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123",
  "confirmPassword": "SecurePass123",
  "adminSecretKey": "your-secret-key"
}

// Step 2: Admin logs in (same as everyone else)
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "john@admin.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123"
}

// Response includes admin-specific data
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Login successful",
  "user": {
    "id": "...",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Admin",
    "email": "john@admin.com",
    "role": "admin",
    "isSuperAdmin": true,
    "isEmailVerified": true
  },
  "tokens": {
    "accessToken": "...",
    "refreshToken": "..."
  }
}
üõ°Ô∏è Security Features
Admin Registration Security

Secret Key Protection - Only people with secret key can register
Environment Variable - Secret key stored securely
Production Safety - Setup endpoint disabled in production
One-time Super Admin - Only first admin becomes super admin

Admin Access Control

Role-based Authentication - Different permissions for super vs standard admin
Token-based Security - Same JWT system as other users
Account Status Checks - Active account verification
Audit Trail - Track admin actions (implement later)

üìù Environment Variables Required
env# JWT Security
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key-here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret-key-here

# Admin Registration
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your-admin-registration-secret-key

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development
üöÄ Deployment Strategy
Development Environment

Use POST /api/auth/setup/super-admin to create first admin
Or use secret key registration
Both methods available

Production Environment

Setup endpoint disabled automatically
Only secret key registration available
Manually create first admin via database if needed
Share secret key only with trusted team members

üîí Best Practices
Security

Keep secret key private - Don't commit to version control
Use strong passwords - Minimum 8 characters for admins
Rotate secret keys periodically
Monitor admin actions (implement audit logging)

Account Management

Create super admin first - They have full control
Limit admin accounts - Only create what you need
Regular password updates - Enforce strong password policies
Deactivate unused accounts - Keep active admin list clean

üìã Admin Capabilities
Based on your API documentation, admins can:
Platform Management

View dashboard and analytics
Manage platform settings
Configure commission rates
Monitor system health

User Management

List and manage all users
Ban/unban user accounts
Delete user accounts
View user details and activity

Seller Management

Approve/reject seller applications
Suspend seller accounts
Verify seller documents
Manage seller performance

Product Management

Approve/reject products
Remove products from platform
Manage product categories
Monitor product quality

Order Management

View all platform orders
Process refunds
Handle disputes
Manage order issues

Financial Management

Track platform revenue
Manage seller payouts
Monitor commission collection
Generate financial reports

üîÑ Login Process Summary

Admin Registration (one-time):

Use secret key to register admin account
First admin becomes super admin automatically


Admin Login (daily use):

Same login endpoint as customers/sellers: POST /api/auth/login
System recognizes admin role automatically
Returns admin-specific permissions and data


Admin Access:

Use JWT tokens for authenticated requests
Role-based middleware protects admin routes
Super admin has elevated privileges



The beauty of this system is that all roles use the same login endpoint, but the system automatically handles the different permissions and access levels based on the user's role and status.
